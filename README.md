# About Mastoget

Mastoget is your feed retriever for the Mastodon network. This amazing site feeds all the public posts posted across the entire Mastodon network to your web browser.
<br><br>
Mastoget can retrieve 5 randomly selected Mastodon-servers at a time; this is to avoid overloading this site's servers as every visitor visit means an individual request to these Mastodon servers. 
<br><br>
We use relays so that the entire Mastoget network will not fall when the traffic boosts up.
