# About Mastoget

Mastoget is your feed retriever for the Mastodon network. This amazing site feeds all the public posts posted across the entire Mastodon network to your web browser.

Mastoget can retrieve 5 randomly selected Mastodon-servers at a time; this is to avoid overloading this site's servers as every visitor visit means an individual request to these Mastodon servers.
